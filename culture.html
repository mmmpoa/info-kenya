        Kenyan culture is rich and diverse, shaped by over 40 ethnic groups,
        each with its own language, traditions, and customs. While modern life
        is influenced by technology and urbanization, traditional values, family
        ties, and community remain important. Kenyan culture blends indigenous
        practices with global influences, especially from British colonial
        history, resulting in a unique mix of old and new.
